 <p align="center">A scalable <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> framework for building <a href="https://discord.com">Discord</a> Bots</p>

# Description

Watson is a Discord bot framework heavily inspired by the architecture of <a href="https://github.com/nestjs/nest">NestJS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular">Angular</a>. It uses TypeScript to provide an easy to use API to scale along with the growth and complexity of your service.

As an interface to the Discord API we use <a href="https://discord.js.org">DiscordJS</a> though we also plan to support other client frameworks in the future.
