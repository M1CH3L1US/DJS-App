 * Allows to refer to references which are not yet defined.

 * For instance, `forwardRef` is used when the `token` which we need to refer to for the purposes of
 * DI is declared, but not yet defined.
 *
 * Refer to the {@link [Angular usage notes of forward ref](https://angular.io/api/core/forwardRef)}
 *
 * ForwardRef does not, like in NestJS, help you to resolve circular dependencies.
 * You should use {@link Lazy} for that purpose.
